# SIMULATIONS
Repository of simulations with descriptions compatible with IMPEx-SPASE

## How to describe a simulation

Use your favorite editor to build what we call an impex tree, an XML file all the metadata related to the simulation outputs.

You can use [this file](https://github.com/CDPP-IRAP/SIMULATIONS/blob/master/trees/BT_Tree4.xml) as template.
